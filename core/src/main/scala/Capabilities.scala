/**
  * A Set of capabilities that a server possesses.
  * 
  * this set of capabilities will be transmitted from Server to client
  * at the time when a connection is built.
  * 
  * Currently there is only one known capability, which is the
  * "Remotely 1.0" capability.
  * 
  * You can see this if you telnet to a running remotely server:
  * {{{
      $ telnet localhost 9999
      Trying 127.0.0.1...
      Connected to localhost.
      Escape character is '^]'.
      OK: [Remotely 1.0]
  * }}}
  * 
  * The OK line spit out by the server contains a comma separated list
  * of capabilities between the square brackets.
  * 
  * In the future we might revision our wire format, perhaps because
  * we want to also allow for XML serialization of objects. Perhaps we
  * want to add STARTTLS support, perhaps we want to add a way to
  * fetch documentation for the functions exported by this server,
  * someday in the future, a remotely server might respond with:
  * 
  * OK: [Remotely 1.0, STARTTLS, Remotely XML 1.0, Remotely 2.0]
  * 
  * When the client receives this string as part of the connection
  * negotiation, it can perhaps adapt its behavior depending on the
  * server capabilities, or it could decide not to talk to this
  * server.
